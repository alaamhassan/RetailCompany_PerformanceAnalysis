## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ask Phase:
I went through **5** steps.

‚ù∂ **Understand the Business Problem**

The CEO of a retail company that sells bags, shoes, accessories, and other related products has a record of all the orders in the years 2019 and 2020. The CEO wants to know if his business is going in the right direction or not.

‚ù∑ **Understand the stakeholders‚Äô expectations**

This helps in identifying the end goals of the project:

üö© Determine if the company‚Äôs sales performance improved in the year 2020 over 2019.

üö© Identify strategies for improving sales performance.

‚ù∏ **Understand the Problem Domain**

This helps in identifying the KPIs and insights needed to achieve the goals of the project.

‚ùπ **Asking the right questions**

Going through the previous steps helps to know which questions to ask. These are the questions that, if answered, the goals of the project will be achieved.

‚ù∫ **Making the Scope of Work Report**

<a name="scope_of_work"></a>
üì∞ Making the [Scope of Work](https://github.com/alaamhassan/RetailCompany_PerformanceAnalysis/blob/main/Ask_Phase/Scope%20of%20Work.pdf) report is the last step in this phase.
<a name="process_phase"></a>
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Process Phase:
In this step, I had to make sure that the data is:

üìå Accurate

üìå Complete

üìå Trustworthy

üìå Comprehensive

The data was made sure it:

* aligns with business logic.
* doesn‚Äôt contain duplicates.
* doesn‚Äôt contain mistyping.
* doesn‚Äôt contain blank fields.
* doesn‚Äôt have mismatched data types.
  
and many others‚Ä¶

<a name="changelog_process_phase"></a>
üì∞ if the data violates any of those things, it will be both cleaned and documented in the 
[Changelog Document](https://github.com/alaamhassan/RetailCompany_PerformanceAnalysis/blob/main/Process_Phase/Changelog%20Documentation.pdf).

‚úÖ The Process phase resulted in **17 Changes** taking the IDs from C1 to C17 in the [Changelog Document](https://github.com/alaamhassan/RetailCompany_PerformanceAnalysis/blob/main/Process_Phase/Changelog%20Documentation.pdf).

<a name="analyze_phase"></a>
## 3Ô∏è‚É£Analyze Phase:

In this phase, I want through **three** steps:

‚ù∂ **Adjusting and Adding any needed column for analysis**

<a name="changelog_analyze_phase"></a>
‚úÖ In this step, I have **adjusted and added 8 columns** for analysis taking the IDs from C18 to C25 in the [Changelog Document](https://github.com/alaamhassan/RetailCompany_PerformanceAnalysis/blob/main/Process_Phase/Changelog%20Documentation.pdf). 

‚ù∑ **Performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**

I performed EDA to know the distribution of certain columns to determine if average or median was the most appropriate solution to measure the central value.

‚ù∏ **making pivot tables**
I used power pivot to make pivot tables.
