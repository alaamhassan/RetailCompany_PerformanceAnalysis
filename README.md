# Sales Performance Analysis - Excel Project
This project consists of four phases.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ask Phase:
I went through **5** steps.

‚ù∂ **Understand the Business Problem**

The CEO of a retail company that sells bags, shoes, accessories, and other related products has a record of all the orders in the years 2019 and 2020. The CEO wants to know if his business is going in the right direction or not.

‚ù∑ **Understand the stakeholders‚Äô expectations**

This helps in identifying the end goals of the project:

üö© Determine if the company‚Äôs sales performance improved in the year 2020 over 2019.

üö© Identify strategies for improving sales performance.

‚ù∏ **Understand the Problem Domain**

This helps in identifying the KPIs and insights needed to achieve the goals of the project.

‚ùπ **Asking the right questions**

Going through the previous steps helps to know which questions to ask. These are the questions that, if answered, the goals of the project will be achieved.

‚ù∫ **Making the Scope of Work Report**

Making the Scope of Work report is the last step in this phase.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Process Phase:
In this step, I had to make sure that the data is:

üìå Accurate

üìå Complete

üìå Trustworthy

üìå Comprehensive

The data was made sure it:

aligns with business logic.
doesn‚Äôt contain duplicates.
doesn‚Äôt contain mistyping.
doesn‚Äôt contain blank fields.
doesn‚Äôt have mismatched data types.
and many others‚Ä¶

If the data violates any of those things, it will be both cleaned and documented in the Changelog Document.

The Process phase resulted in **17 Changes** taking the IDs from C1 to C17 in the Changelog Document.

if the data violates any of those things, it will be both cleaned and documented in the 
[Changelog Document](https://github.com/alaamhassan/RetailCompany_PerformanceAnalysis/blob/main/Process_Phase/Changelog%20Documentation.pdf).

The Process phase resulted in **17 Changes** taking the ids from C1 to C17 in the [Changelog Document](https://github.com/alaamhassan/RetailCompany_PerformanceAnalysis/blob/main/Process_Phase/Changelog%20Documentation.pdf).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£Analyze Phase:

In this phase, I want through **three** steps:

‚ù∂ **Adjusting and Adding any needed column for analysis**

In this step, I have **adjusted and added 8 columns** for analysis taking the IDs from C18 to C25 in the [Changelog Document](https://github.com/alaamhassan/RetailCompany_PerformanceAnalysis/blob/main/Process_Phase/Changelog%20Documentation.pdf). 

‚ù∑ **Performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**

I performed EDA to know the distribution of certain columns to determine if average or median was the most appropriate solution to measure the central value.

‚ù∏ **making pivot tables**
I used power pivot to make pivot tables.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£Share Phase:

There are two deliverables in this phase:
1. **Dashboard**:
   
  This **dashboard is dynamic**, which changes by:
  *  changing 9 slicers.
  *  show vs revenue or net profit.
  *  show as values or percentages.

  both the labels and the headers change.

  The Dashboard Contains four pages:
