## 1️⃣ Ask Phase:
I went through **5** steps.

❶ **Understand the Business Problem**

The CEO of a retail company that sells bags, shoes, accessories, and other related products has a record of all the orders in the years 2019 and 2020. The CEO wants to know if his business is going in the right direction or not.

❷ **Understand the stakeholders’ expectations**

This helps in identifying the end goals of the project:

🚩 Determine if the company’s sales performance improved in the year 2020 over 2019.

🚩 Identify strategies for improving sales performance.

❸ **Understand the Problem Domain**

This helps in identifying the KPIs and insights needed to achieve the goals of the project.

❹ **Asking the right questions**

Going through the previous steps helps to know which questions to ask. These are the questions that, if answered, the goals of the project will be achieved.

❺ **Making the Scope of Work Report**

<a name="scope_of_work"></a>
📰 Making the [Scope of Work](https://github.com/alaamhassan/RetailCompany_PerformanceAnalysis/blob/main/Ask_Phase/Scope%20of%20Work.pdf) report is the last step in this phase.

## 2️⃣ Process Phase:
In this step, I had to make sure that the data is:

📌 Accurate.

📌 Complete.

📌 Consistant.

📌 Trustworthy.

📌 Comprehensive.

The data was made sure it:

* aligns with business logic.
* doesn’t contain duplicates.
* doesn’t contain mistyping.
* doesn’t contain blank fields.
* doesn’t have mismatched data types.
  
and many others…

<a name="changelog_process_phase"></a>
📰 if the data violates any of those things, it will be both cleaned and documented in the 
[Changelog Document](https://github.com/alaamhassan/RetailCompany_PerformanceAnalysis/blob/main/Process_Phase/Changelog%20Documentation.pdf).

✅ The Process phase resulted in **17 Changes** taking the IDs from C1 to C17 in the [Changelog Document](https://github.com/alaamhassan/RetailCompany_PerformanceAnalysis/blob/main/Process_Phase/Changelog%20Documentation.pdf).

## 3️⃣Analyze Phase:

In this phase, I want through **three** steps:

❶ **Adjusting and Adding any needed column for analysis**

<a name="changelog_analyze_phase"></a>
✅ In this step, I have **adjusted and added 8 columns** for analysis taking the IDs from C18 to C25 in the [Changelog Document](https://github.com/alaamhassan/RetailCompany_PerformanceAnalysis/blob/main/Process_Phase/Changelog%20Documentation.pdf). 

❷ **Performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**

I performed EDA to know the distribution of certain columns to determine if average or median was the most appropriate solution to measure the central value.

❸ **Making pivot tables**

I used power pivot to make pivot tables.
